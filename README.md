randomname.py is a simple program that uses two .txt files to randomly generate a first and last name.
The list of names were from a 4000+ list of names for first and last names.
I am creating this to become more familiar with working with data from different files in my program.
I might also eventually convert the program to use csv files.
I could also work on command line arguements where the user adds them when running the program through cli.
It would be interesting to have it working to where depending on how many arguements or what type of files
used in arguements will determine which path the program takes in randomly generating a name.
